						<h2>Bio</h2>
						
						<div class="content bio">
							<p>Since the age of 16 years young, Draper had always been intrigued as to how music is made - 
							after hearing songs being played out on the radio he would instinctively go about discovering not 
							just their construction in the sense of instrumentation and lyricism, but also the array of production 
							methods employed on a plethora of different genres. Far from being born into a recording studio environment, 
							he acquired the most basic of sound recording software and began experimenting in collaboration with various 
							underground and grass roots artists.
							</p>
							<p>Two years later, inspired by the stiff competition on producer-based website Indaba Music and the vast numbers
							of online EDM communities, he became heavily involved in the remixing scene.</p>
							<p>After rising through the ranks, he appeared frequently on the winners' list at Indaba, winning accolades such as 
							runner up on the Laurie Anderson competition judged by Lou Reed, first prize in the 'Electronic Musician' and 
							'Conspiracy For Good' original composition contests, and runner up in The Qemists remix competition.</p>
							<p>Draper's first real musical impact to the world-at-large arrived when he remixed a video commentary by YouTube 
							celebrity Chris Smoove. The remix, entitled Waiting On A Noob, went on to become his first release, reaching the 
							Number 14 spot on iTunes' Hip-Hop/Rap chart within days of its release.</p>
							<p>At the end of 2010, whilst studying at Oxford Brookes University, he released his first digital EP entitled 
							The Introduction. A vibrant online reaction ensued from simply cold-dropping this EP onto the internet, which 
							resulted in the EP being featured on several prominent blogs - ultimately, this brought Draper to the attention of 
							Bring Me The Horizon frontman and Drop Dead Clothing owner Oliver Sykes, who expressed his interest in working with 
							this promising young producer.</p>
							<p>The result was Draper's second release, The Draper EP, as a physical CD and limited-edition t-shirt bundle through 
							Drop Dead in February 2012, followed by Draper's first ever live appearance - a Bring Me The Horizon after show party 
							at Brixton Academy in London. The association with the band even led to Draper writing music sections to form parts of 
							the band's live set; culminating in one of his tracks being played over the PA system situated at the Reading Festival 
							during Bring Me The Horizon's performance on the main stage in August 2011.</p>
							<p>Since, during and in-between all of these events taking place, Draper continued to engage and embrace a range of 
							genres through his own creations in tandem with a string of prolific remixes - both laden with his unique, trademark 
							liquidstep style of production - which have seen his online following explode both in terms of numbers and geographical 
							reach. This remix repertoire includes his work on Strange Talk, Worship, Bring Me The Horizon, Bluebell, and many more. 
							Each time a remix or production is placed online, within a matter of days it has gone viral via sharing on YouTube channels
							and Soundcloud embeds linked back to Draper's own.</p>
							<p>In June 2012, following finishing his University degree with first-class honours, rising pop star Rita Ora personally
							invited Draper to DJ for her at the 2012 Capital Radio Summer Ball, which saw the young 20 year-old perform to a sold-out 
							Wembley Stadium - or 100,000 people. This was his 6th ever live appearance.</p>
							<p>The rest of 2012 will see Draper continuing to put out new creations, via his new label imprint Creasy Records, and 
							escalating the profile of his work via collaborations with a number of prominent artists and producers. Then there's the 
							live band...</p>
